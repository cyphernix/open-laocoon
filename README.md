# Open-Laocoon
Open Laocoon is a Fully Open Source Bayesian based Network Anomaly Detection Engine in development.

# What is Open-Laocoon?
It inspects network traffic and creates a profile of machines and the services those machines typically make use of and it then informs you of any suspicious anomaly network activity. That does not match that general profile of that system.

Currently only one or two offerings I know of are available on the market for this and they are extremly expensive commercial offerings. So why not pursue the Open Source model and make it available to all with a support offering optional if required. 
That's what Open Laoco√∂n will hopefully address when it's ready.

Currently it's being developed and tested in an Air Gapped environment. So nothing to see here, just yet.

#Why the name Open-Laocoon?

Well we wanted to make an open source offering and Laocoon was the character in Virgil's Aeneid, Book II. He was the one quoted to have said. "Equo ne credite, Teucri. Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes." 
("Do not trust the horse Trojans! Whatever it is, I fear the Greeks, even bringing gifts.") 
So we thought it would be fitting to acknowlege him by naming the application after someone who warned of Trojan Horses.
